# What does the software do ?

This Car_and_pedestrian_detection software detetcts the cars by drawing a red coloured rectangle around them and the pedestrians by drawing a yellow coloured rectangle around them.


Though the accuracy may not be perfect, it is a simple and good way to detect cars and pedestrians.
